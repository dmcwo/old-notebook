Today created my first [Jekyll pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) and also learned a bit about using google fonts w/ jekyll. Here's how you do it:<!--break-->

First, head over to <https://www.google.com/fonts> and find your favorite font(s). You can add a bunch of fonts to a "collection" or just choose one and click the "quick use" icon. That's what I did with a font called [Arvo](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Arvo), just to test out the process. Here's the code generated by quick use:

```
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo:400,400italic,700,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

To add it to jekyll, paste this code into the ```head.html``` file in the ```includes``` folder.


Next, edit your ```main.scss``` to start using the font on your site. Just as an example, this would set Arvo as the base font for the site:

```
$base-font-family: 'Arvo', "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
```

Fun!

Next up, maybe something like [next and previous buttons](http://jdp.org.uk/jekyll/2015/06/01/next-and-previous-posts-in-jekyll.html)

And also, maybe I'll work on creating a zotero citation export format to markdown, so that Zotero can export something like this:

```
* [Writing, Searching, Thinking, Learning: Cross-Training Peer Research and Writing Tutors to Maximize Student Success](http://www.loexconference.org/sessions.html). Presented at the LOEX Annual Conference in Grand Rapids, MI on May 10, 2014.
```

which will then display like this:

* [Writing, Searching, Thinking, Learning: Cross-Training Peer Research and Writing Tutors to Maximize Student Success](http://www.loexconference.org/sessions.html). Presented at the LOEX Annual Conference in Grand Rapids, MI on May 10, 2014.
