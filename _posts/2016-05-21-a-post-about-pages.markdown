Today created my first [Jekyll pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) and also learned a bit about using google fonts w/ jekyll. Here's how you do it:

First, head over to <https://www.google.com/fonts> and find your favorite font(s). You can add a bunch of fonts to a "collection" or just choose one and click the "quick use" icon. That's what I did with a font called [Arvo](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Arvo), just to test out the process. Here's the code generated by quick use:

```
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo:400,400italic,700,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

To add it to jekyll, paste this code into the ```head.html``` file in the ```includes``` folder.


Next, edit your ```main.scss``` to start using the font on your site. Just as an example, this would set Arvo as the base font for the site:

```
$base-font-family: 'Arvo', "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
```

Fun!
