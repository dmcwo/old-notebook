I'm suddenly a huge fan of text files. <!--break--> Blogging w/ just text files -- why is that so cool? For some reason, it really is. I first got started playing around with [jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and then learned about [course-in-a-box](http://howto.p2pu.org/) both of which made me think that static is the new dynamic, for real.

Not that it is all text. I just learned that if you type this:

```
![Straws in a window]({{ site.url }}/files/IMG_1847.jpg)
```

You can make this happen:

![Straws in a window]({{ site.url }}/files/IMG_1847.jpg)

What's next after that? Maybe more text?

* [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
* [xml](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp)
* [markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) & [more markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

and then, maybe, these, too:
