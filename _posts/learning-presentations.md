coding your presentations

[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

1. Cloned it to make a local copy
2. Created a branch of jekyll directory to experiment w/ incorporating presentations
3. Created a ```presentations``` directory
4. Copied ```reveal.js``` files into ```presentations``` - still wondering if I should use the sub-module feature for this….?
5. Navigated to the local repository in terminal and did ```jekyll serve``` to make sure I could test this out. Works!
	1. [ ] Why did a new favicon.ico appear? where did that come from?
6. Started thinking about a naming convention for presentations. Also thinking about whether or not to use a jekyll naming convention and then try to make an ```index.html``` page to fit in w/ the rest of the site…. that would be better.
7. Started with experimenting with linking to presentations from current ```index.html``` works well enough ….
8. Made a new index to be a part of general jekyll framework. Turned on the experiment with tyled ```<ul>```'s and linked to the demo presentations.
